# Shaper

This program is used as an example of how to use the HansVisual library (visualizerClass class). It uses everything this library provides, so is very useful for learning and documentation. This is a playground for low level 3D drawing. This program makes basic shapes/points/lines using the (static) library "visualizer_class", that uses OpenGL. 

Set the variable OP_SYSTEM from the CMakeLists.txt to Linux or Windows, depending on which operative system you will build and compile this program.
