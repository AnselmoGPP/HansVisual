HansVisual is a C++ library for 3D data visualization. It allows the programmer to easily show different objects (points, lines, surfaces, cubes) with different properties. If what you want is to call functions, from your code, for showing graphics, this library is for you. From your code you can call them for opening a window and drawing different objects in a 3-dimensional space. You can create different layers and draw different things on each one. Each layer has its own palette of colors, and you can modify it whenever you want in your code. But this library includes even more tools such as transparencies, background color selection, data window, adding your own palettes, creation of layers at compile-time and/or run-time, etc. Get all the information you need in the following link:
